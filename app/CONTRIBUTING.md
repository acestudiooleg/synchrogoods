## What should I know before I get started?

### Driver App

Driver App is a mobile application designed to make our drivers and dispatchers life easier. The main concept lying in it is to provide an easy-to-walk-through user interface accessible for drivers of the big trash disposal trucks. Driver should be able to log in, check in, pre-trip, start a work order, get a direction to go, and do other work order related stuff until it's completion.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will be documenting them in the [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) file. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is *not* documented there, please open a new topic in [jira](https://marketsoup.atlassian.net/) and ask your question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Driver App. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [debugging guide](DEBUGGING.md).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Driver App.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://marketsoup.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=-4)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [Jira issues](https://marketsoup.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=-4). After you've determined the way to reproduce the bug, create an issue and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that Driver App crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace.
* **If the problem is related to performance**, include a CPU profile capture and a screenshot with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Driver App) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Driver App?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Driver App from [the releases page](https://bitbucket.org/marketsoup/driverapp/downloads?tab=downloads).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Driver App are you using?** You can get the exact version in the `package.json`.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running Driver App in a browser?** If so, which browser are you using?
* **Are you running Driver App in an emulator?** If so, which emulator are you using and which Android AVD settings are used?

If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-enhancement-suggestions) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [debugging guide](DEBUGGING.md)** for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version of Driver App.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://marketsoup.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=-4)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

### Your First Code Contribution

### Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [JavaScript](#javascript-styleguide),
  and [CSS](#css-styleguide) styleguides.
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured
  [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) tests in the `./test/unit` folder or/and in the each separate component as a `*.test.js`. Run them using `npm run test:unit`. See the [Specs Styleguide](#specs-styleguide) below.
* Document new code based on the
  [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
    * Use `require('fs-plus').getHomeDirectory()` to get the home directory.
    * Use `path.join()` to concatenate filenames.
    * Use `os.tmpdir()` rather than `/tmp` when you need to reference the
      temporary directory.
* Using a plain `return` when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
    * Not `return null`, `return undefined`, `null`, or `undefined`

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use `npm run commit` instead of any other way to commit
* Choose the right type of a change
    * **feat** is a new feature.
      It means that if this change is allowed to merge to the master branch, it will bump the minor version of the Driver App (1.x.0)
    * **fix** is a bug fix.
      Will bump the bugfix version of the Driver App (1.0.x)
* Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to this style guide. You can check it using `npm run lint`.

* Use the principle:
    * no code - no problem.
    * the less code we write, the less problems we have.
    * the more code we write, the more problems we have.
* Do not overengineer it.
* Do not get carried away by the decomposition.
* Do not implement things which are not required by your task.

### Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured
  [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) tests in the `./test/unit` folder or/and in the each separate component as a `*.test.js`.
- Include representative storybooks for components in the directories of each separate component as a `*.story.js`.
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [calabash](http://calaba.sh/) features in the `./features` folder.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use inline comments to explain difficult points.
* Do not write code comments to the code that is obvious enough.
* Use Hindley-Milner type system notation to document functions.
* Write input/output examples for the functions to make easy to reason about them without any execution.

#### Example

```js
// map :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
// map(R.add(1), [1, 2, 3])
// > [2, 3, 4]
const map = (f, a) => a.map(f);
```
